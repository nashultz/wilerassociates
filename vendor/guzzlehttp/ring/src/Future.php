/**
 * Future ring response that may or may not have completed.
 *
 * Future responses act just like a normal response hash. It can be iterated,
 * counted, and you can access it using associative array style access. When
 * the future response is used like a normal response hash, the future of the
 * response is "realized" (meaning blocks until the request has completed), and
 * the actual response is then used as the internal response data.
 *
 * Futures can be cancelled if they have not already been realized.
 * Cancelling a future will prevent the future from executing the dereference
 * function and will execute the function provided to the future that actually
 * handles the cancellation (e.g., telling an event loop to stop sending a
 * request or to close a socket). If no cancel function is provided, then a
 * request cannot be cancelled. If a cancel function is provided, then it
 * should accept the future as an argument and return true if the future was
 * successfully cancelled or false if it could not be cancelled.
